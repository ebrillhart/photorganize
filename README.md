# photorganize
For Instagram. Use to categorize and notate photos that you've liked.

## How-To
### 1. Log In
Log into photOrganize using your Instagram account. Don't worry, your data will never be shared with third parties.
### 2. Dashboard
Once logged in, you'll be able to view your dashboard, which has all of the photos that you've liked from your Instagram account. You can also search for photos by tag once you've added tags to your photos.
### 3. Add Tags and Notes
By clicking on a photo on your dashboard, you'll be able to access the photo's details, including who posted it, the original caption, a link to Google Maps to view location, and a link to view the photo on Instagram. You can also add tags to make your photos searchable, and notes. These help you keep track of photos that you've liked in a way that makes sense to you.
### 4. Archive
Don't feel the need to keep track of a photo you've liked? Archive it. This will hide the photo from your dashboard. Want to keep track of photos you've archived or accidentally archive a photo you want to see on your dashboard? You can access all archived photos from your profile page. From there, you can restore any photo that you've archived to your dashboard, along with its associated tags and notes.

## About
photOrganize was built by Emma Brillhart as a project for General Assembly's Web Design Immersive Course. The concept for the site was borne out of frustration over not being able to easily use photos liked on Instagram as a bookmark or reminder (particularly for good-looking restaurants!).

### User Stories
###### Fashion Follower
This Instagram user follows a lot of fashion bloggers, or perhaps is a fashion blogger herself. When she sees an outfit or style that she likes, she wants to be able to reference it in the future. photOrganize allows her to add tags based on season, clothing item, etc. and add notes about styling.
###### Foodie
This user is always looking for new restaurants to try in her city and others, and uses Instagram as a primary way of finding them. With photOrganize, she can add tags for things like city and cuisine and easily track them later when she goes on a trip or is craving a particular type of food.
